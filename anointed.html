    <p class="synopsis"> 
        Exiled from the kingdom they once served, Saiden and Mozare have spent the last several months in the Southern Kingdom of Taezhali, learning Saiden’s new power and training for the fight back home. Together with their friends they’ve survived horrific experiments, hostage situations, and life with Cassimir’s family. Now it’s time for them to return to face the consequences of the rebellion they helped win.
        At home, things have turned bleak. The hope the rebellion once represented now hidden by paranoia and the threat of treachery. The king they raised into power had begun a slow descent into darkness. And Saiden is determined not to let it ruin the kingdom she fought for.
        With the stakes higher than ever, will these allies be able to turn away from their differences and fight for the soul of their country, or will darkness soon consume them all? Follow the last branch of their journey as each member of our group must face their own demons and the darkness of their past, or risk losing everything they believe in.
