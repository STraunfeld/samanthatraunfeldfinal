        <p class="synopsis">Saiden a blood-cursed Legionnaire—blessed by both the God of Life and Goddess of Death—is a paradox. Called both “Death-bringer” and “World-ender” she is surprisingly careful about taking lives and proving herself to be a monster. Torn between her loyalty to her queen and the need to protect her people, Saiden struggles to decide who she is going to be in a world that has already cast her aside.
    
    Queen Loralei is hiding the fact that she’s been blessed by the God of Life at the same time she is navigating the manipulative and dangerous landscape of ruling a kingdom. When she discovers a mysterious prisoner in her dungeons, she begins to unravel a complicated plot that shadows over her reign and would change the course of history.
    
    Mozare, gifted by the Goddess of Death with the powers to control shadows, is hiding lots of secrets in the dark. As Saiden’s legionnaire partner, he would do everything to protect her—even if that means killing the queen she swore to protect to save her from a fate worse than death.
    With friends and enemies becoming indistinguishable from each other, can these three individuals survive long enough to fulfill their destinies without losing those closest to them, or will their missions irreparably ruin them, and possibly the entire kingdom?</p>
